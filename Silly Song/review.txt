PROJECT REVIEW:

Meets Specifications:

Core Methods 2/2
User Interface 6/6
Actions and Methods 5/5

Comments:

ViewController.swift:
Suggestion: can delete didReceiveMemoryWarning: you haven't added any custom code here, so you can remove this method.
func textFieldShouldReturn -- Awesome!
func displayLyrics -- Awesome! Great job using optional binding syntax here. Suggestion: you could change the if let to a guard statement.

SongData.swift
func shortNameFromName -- Awesome. Nice work!
func lyricsForName -- Awesome. This function works great! 

**I've implimented both suggestions in the current code.
